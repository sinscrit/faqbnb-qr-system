# HANDOVER

## Current Goal

Implement a full autonomous audit of this repository so the project can be restarted with a maintainable, LLM-friendly plan.

## Operating Rules From User

- Perform all logical audit steps autonomously.
- Use best judgement and keep moving if a topic is blocked.
- Commit after every logical step.
- Maintain this handover so another LLM can continue if interrupted.

## Baseline Context

- Date captured: 2026-07-10
- Repository path: `/Users/shinyqk/Documents/mastuff/proj/ai_stuff/aibnb/faqbnb_manus`
- Branch at audit start: `fix-qr-code-generation`
- HEAD at audit start: `f2cd626`
- Product appears to be FAQBNB, a QR-code instruction SaaS for short-term rental hosts.
- Stack appears to be Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, next-intl, PDF/QR libraries, Vitest, and Playwright.

## Pre-Existing Dirty Worktree At Audit Start

These changes existed before the audit and should not be reverted or accidentally swept into unrelated commits:

- Modified: `.mcp.json`
- Modified: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Modified: `src/components/InstructionsTable/GuideCard.tsx`
- Modified: `src/components/ItemManager/components/ItemRow.tsx`
- Modified: `src/components/PropertySelector.tsx`
- Untracked: `gcloud_auth_url.txt`
- Untracked: `src/components/DebugBadge.tsx`
- Untracked: `src/contexts/DebugContext.tsx`

## Audit Progress

- Completed: baseline state capture and audit scaffolding.
- Next: map product intent and route/application surface.

## Commit Discipline

Commit only audit artifacts unless a later task intentionally changes code. Use pathspecs in `git add` to avoid including pre-existing app changes.
