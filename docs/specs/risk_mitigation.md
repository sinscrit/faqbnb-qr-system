## Risk Mitigation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Over-analyzing obvious implementations**: Don't document what's clearly specified in PRD
- **Missing critical customizations**: Focus on business logic not in original specs
- **Ignoring technical debt**: Document shortcuts and workarounds that affect functionality
- **Specification drift**: Ensure final specs reflect actual implementation, not ideal implementation
- **Context loss**: Maintain traceability between PRD intent and implementation reality

### Success Criteria
- Another development team can rebuild the application with identical functionality
- All business stakeholders can understand what the current system actually does
- Technical specifications accurately reflect implementation complexity and dependencies
- Operational teams have sufficient detail for deployment and maintenance
- Change history is preserved and understood for future development decisions
