## Phase 1: Architecture & Implementation Validation

### 1. Technology Stack & Architecture Verification
- [ ] Map current technology stack against PRD architecture recommendations
- [ ] Document actual vs. intended deployment architecture
- [ ] Identify deviations from original technical specifications
- [ ] Verify database design matches PRD data requirements
- [ ] Document infrastructure and scalability implementations

### 2. Feature Implementation Assessment
- [ ] Cross-reference implemented features against PRD feature list
- [ ] Identify features implemented but not in PRD (scope creep analysis)
- [ ] Document features in PRD but not implemented (gaps)
- [ ] Analyze feature completeness against use case acceptance criteria
- [ ] Map request register changes to current feature implementations
