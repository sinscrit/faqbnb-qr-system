## Key Principles for Execution

### Focus Areas
1. **Validate Against Intent**: Always compare implementation to PRD/use cases first
2. **Document Deviations**: Clearly identify where implementation differs from specs
3. **Capture Evolution**: Use request register to understand why changes were made
4. **Implementation Reality**: Document what actually exists, not what was planned
5. **Reconstruction Readiness**: Ensure specs enable identical rebuilding

### Efficiency Guidelines
- **Start with PRD**: Use existing documentation as the baseline, don't reverse-engineer from scratch
- **Focus on Gaps**: Spend time on undocumented or changed functionality
- **Leverage Use Cases**: Use existing acceptance criteria rather than creating new ones
- **Request Register Context**: Understand the "why" behind implementation changes
- **Avoid Over-Documentation**: Don't document what's already well-specified in PRD

### Quality Checkpoints
- [ ] Can another team rebuild identical functionality from these specifications?
- [ ] Are all implementation deviations from PRD clearly documented and justified?
- [ ] Do specifications reflect the current state, not the originally intended state?
- [ ] Are all request register changes properly incorporated into final specs?
- [ ] Is the documentation organized for both technical and business stakeholders?
