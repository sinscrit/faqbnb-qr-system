## Phase 4: Gap Analysis & Specification Generation

### 7. Implementation vs. Specification Gap Analysis
- [ ] Create comprehensive gap analysis between PRD and implementation
- [ ] Document request register items that modified original specifications
- [ ] Identify critical business logic not captured in original documentation
- [ ] Map technical debt and implementation shortcuts
- [ ] Document configuration and environment-specific implementations

### 8. Current State Technical Specification
- [ ] Generate accurate API documentation reflecting current implementation
- [ ] Document actual database schema with relationships and constraints
- [ ] Create deployment guide for current infrastructure setup
- [ ] Document integration specifications as currently implemented
- [ ] Map security model and access controls as implemented

### 9. Updated Requirements Documentation
- [ ] Create revised user stories reflecting current functionality
- [ ] Update business requirements based on implementation analysis
- [ ] Document new features and capabilities added via request register
- [ ] Create acceptance criteria for all current features
- [ ] Map current user roles and permissions

### 10. Implementation-Ready Specifications
- [ ] Generate detailed technical specifications for current state
- [ ] Create component and module specifications with dependencies
- [ ] Document configuration management and environment requirements
- [ ] Specify testing requirements based on current functionality
- [ ] Create deployment and operational procedures
