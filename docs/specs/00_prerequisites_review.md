# Application Specification Extraction Checklist

This document provides a systematic approach for extracting complete application specifications from an existing codebase when PRD, use cases, and request register are available. Each task is designed as a 1 story point effort for an AI coding agent.

## Prerequisites Review

### 0. Foundation Document Analysis
- [ ] Review PRD to understand intended application purpose, scope, and key features
- [ ] Analyze use cases to understand expected user journeys and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Review request register to understand change history and feature evolution
